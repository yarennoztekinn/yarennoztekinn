## Hi there, I'm Yaren ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student at MuÄŸla SÄ±tkÄ± KoÃ§man University, passionate about learning and growing in the tech world. My GitHub is a collection of my journeyâ€”featuring personal projects, university assignments, and tutorials I've explored to deepen my understanding of algorithms and programming principles.

So far, I've gained experience with:

- Python for programming fundamentals,
- Java for object-oriented programming,
- C for data structures and algorithm design.
  
In a recent university group project, I took on the role of a backend developer, where I worked with the Spring Framework to build a collaborative platform. Exploring new frameworks and programming languages is my way of staying curious and evolving in this field.

Feel free to check out my projects, and don't hesitate to connect or share feedback. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸš€
