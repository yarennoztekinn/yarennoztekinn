  <h1>Hi there, I'm Yaren 👋</h1>
</div>

I'm a Software Engineering student at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University, passionate about learning and growing in the tech world. My GitHub is a collection of my journey—featuring personal projects, university assignments, and tutorials I've explored to deepen my understanding of algorithms and programming principles.

So far, I've gained experience with:

- Backend Development (Java & Spring Boot): Developed two backend projects using the Spring Boot framework, utilizing PostgreSQL for robust database management.

- Backend Development (Go): Built a complete backend system from scratch using the Go Fiber framework. Integrated Redis, Docker Compose, MVC architecture, and JWT authentication for secure and scalable performance.

- Containerization & Python (Django): Developed a backend project with the Django framework, implementing Docker container configuration for streamlined deployment.

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Built and trained models using TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. Successfully completed an end-to-end machine learning project, covering all   stages from data processing to model deployment.

- Reinforcement Learning: Designed a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning project using Tabular Q-learning, featuring a custom visualization built with Pygame.

- Computer Vision: Currently contributing to an image processing project utilizing OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries for real-time analysis.

Feel free to check out my projects, and don't hesitate to connect or share feedback. Let's learn and grow together! 🚀
